26;Why JHipster? Architecture and Stack Overview;JHipster generates a complete production-ready stack from a single command. Learn why JHipster exists, how it combines Spring Boot with Angular, and how Learn With Hamster maps this to a gateway (port 8081, reactive WebFlux) plus a service module (port 8080, Spring MVC and JPA). Watch Episode 01 of the Electronic Armory series to see the same decisions made from scratch.;ENGLISH
27;Designing Your Domain Model with JDL;JHipster Domain Language lets you define all entities and relationships in a single .jdl file before generating any code. Walk through the app.jdl used in this project: Discipline, Program, Course, Lesson, and Resource with ManyToMany and OneToMany relationships and the Level, ResourceType, and Language enums. Run jhipster jdl app.jdl to regenerate everything from this one file.;ENGLISH
28;Interactive: Generate Your JHipster App from Scratch;Install JHipster 8 and generate a full gateway and service from scratch. Install prerequisites: Node.js 22+, Java 17, then run npm install -g generator-jhipster. Create a gateway directory and run jhipster to answer every prompt. Key choices matching this project: application type=gateway, build=Maven, frontend=Angular, reactive=yes, auth=JWT, Consul. Create a service directory and run jhipster again: application type=microservice, reactive=no, build=Maven, JPA+Hibernate, H2 dev with MySQL prod. Finally run jhipster jdl app.jdl in each module to generate all entities and relationships at once. Start everything with docker compose up -d then ./mvnw in each module.;ENGLISH
29;Exploring the Generated Project Structure;Navigate every folder the generator creates. Gateway: webapp/app/entities/ for Angular CRUD, webapp/app/shared/ for auth and directives, config/ for Spring Security and Spring Cloud, and reactive R2DBC repositories. Service: domain/ for JPA entities, service/dto/ for DTOs, service/mapper/ for MapStruct, service/impl/ for business logic, web/rest/ for REST controllers, and repository/ with WithBagRelationships for ManyToMany eager loading. Key config files: .yo-rc.json captures your generator answers and application.yml drives every Spring profile.;ENGLISH
30;Entities, DTOs, and the MapStruct Mapper Chain;JHipster wires entity persistence to REST automatically through a four-step chain. A JPA entity in domain/ is mapped by a MapStruct interface in service/mapper/ to a DTO in service/dto/. The ServiceImpl in service/impl/ uses the repository and mapper, and the REST resource in web/rest/ delegates to the service. In this project Course maps to CourseDTO via CourseMapper, exposed by CourseResource. All DTOs use @JsonIgnoreProperties for nested object safety and ManyToMany bag relationships use a separate repository method to avoid N+1 queries.;ENGLISH
31;Customizing Angular: Browse Module and SCSS Theming;Go beyond the generated entity CRUD to build custom user-facing pages. This project adds an app/browse/ module with standalone Angular components for catalog, discipline, course, and lesson views. Routes are defined in browse.routes.ts without the ADMIN authority guard. SCSS theming overrides Bootstrap variables in _bootstrap-variables.scss (changing $primary to a forest green) and adds CSS custom properties in global.scss for dark mode support. FontAwesome icons are registered centrally in app/config/font-awesome-icons.ts.;ENGLISH
32;Service Discovery with Consul;Consul replaces JHipster Registry for service discovery and centralized Spring Cloud Config. On startup the gateway and service both register themselves with Consul. The gateway reads the service catalog and automatically routes /services/service/** requests to the service module. The shared JWT secret lives in docker/central-server-config/application.yml and is read by both modules via Spring Cloud Config so credentials never need to be duplicated across application.yml files.;ENGLISH
33;Database Migrations with Liquibase;Every schema change is tracked as a Liquibase changelog XML in src/main/resources/config/liquibase/. The master.xml entrypoint includes each changelog in order. JHipster generates one file per entity with createTable and addForeignKeyConstraint. Seed data is loaded with loadData pointing to CSVs in fake-data/ using context="faker" so it only runs in the dev profile. Join table data for ManyToMany relationships is loaded in a separate changelog. To wipe and reload the H2 dev database run mvn clean spring-boot:run from the service directory.;ENGLISH
34;Security: JWT, HttpOnly Cookies, and Content Security Policy;JHipster ships with JWT sent in Authorization headers. This project upgrades to HttpOnly cookie-based auth for XSS resistance: the token is set as a secure HttpOnly cookie on login and validated by a filter on every request. SecurityConfiguration defines which routes are public (the Actuator health endpoint, static assets) and which require authentication. CORS is configured to allow the Angular dev server at port 4200. The Content Security Policy header in application.yml controls frame-src to allow YouTube embeds and script-src to prevent injection attacks.;ENGLISH
35;Running the Full Stack with Docker Compose;A single docker compose up -d at the project root starts all infrastructure services. Consul runs on port 8500 and provides the service registry UI. MySQL runs on two ports: 3306 for the gateway schema and 3307 for the service schema so both databases are isolated. Elasticsearch runs on port 9200 and is used by the service module for full-text search. Each Spring Boot module connects via application-dev.yml which references the same container names Docker sets as hostnames. Start the gateway with ./mvnw in gateway/ and the service with ./mvnw in service/.;ENGLISH
36;Testing: Unit, Integration, and End-to-End;JHipster generates a full test suite covering every layer. Run backend unit tests with mvnw test. Run integration tests with mvnw verify which spins up real MySQL and Elasticsearch containers via Testcontainers. Target a single integration test with -Dit.test=CourseResourceIT. On the Angular side, run npm test for Jest unit tests with coverage or npm run jest for tests only without the ESLint pass. Run npm run e2e for Cypress end-to-end tests against a running app. The generated tests cover REST endpoint status codes, service business logic, and Angular component rendering.;ENGLISH
37;Building for Production and Deploying;Switch to the prod Maven profile with -Pprod to compile against MySQL and enable all caching layers including Hazelcast second-level cache in the service. The Angular production build is triggered automatically by the profile: it runs npm run build which outputs a minified optimized bundle served by Spring Boot as static assets. Key differences in application-prod.yml: database points to real MySQL, Elasticsearch is required, cookie-secure is true, and cache TTLs are longer. For containerized deployment build a Docker image with ./mvnw -Pprod jib:dockerBuild and push to a registry for Kubernetes or ECS deployment.;ENGLISH
